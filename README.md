# Elasticsearch support plugin

This plugin offers some Java helper classes for easier use of Elasticsearch API.

## Resilience fork

As of July 2014, I (@rtkjbillo) had some issues with reliability and consistency of record import. The following changes were made to elasticsearch-knapsack and elasticsearch-support, and suit our particular purposes:

In elasticsearch-knapsack (https://github.com/rtkjbillo/elasticsearch-knapsack):

* Add `_site` directory to plugin build (avoid warnings in ElasticSearch logs)
* Don't flush records every 5 seconds (bulk requests were not containing all records)
* Don't set a maximum data size per bulk request
* We repack .tar.gz archives with data; the recreated .tar files have leading directory entries (index/type). Ignore them.
* Ignore cases where the index already exists when running with createIndex=true

In elasticsearch-support (https://github.com/rtkjbillo/elasticsearch-support):

* Wait 60 seconds for individual bulk import threads to close themselves (avoids terminating threads early)
* Ignore 'client closed' errors and continue to try and import

The version number was changed to 1.2.1.1 and this fork works with ES 1.2.1.
